An extractor is a method or script that pulls a limited set of data out of an objectified save game and combines it with data from other
objectified save games for use in future analysis. 
Objectified save games can be large and contain a lot of unnecessary information. If you just want to know how much money a pop has,
loading all the pop data every time can be very slow. You make an extractor that collects the relevant information for all save games in a 
directory, and then you can write scripts to analyze that information.
